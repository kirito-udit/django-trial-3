00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:23,140
war is a universal language I know

3
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,160
renegade soldier when I see one

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,720
never occurred to me that one might come

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,260
from above

6
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,780
space invasion

00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,780
mccartey

8
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,620
truth be told I was ready to hang it up

9
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,370
to let miss you today so you're not for

10
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,260
her on here it's hard to explain

11
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,500
I keep having these memories

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,910
I see flashes

14
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,990
I think I had a life here

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,400
but I can't tell if it's real

17
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:30,310
we have no idea what threats are out

18
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,550
there

19
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:35,969
we can't do this alone

20
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,219
I'm not what you think I am

21
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,149
you
