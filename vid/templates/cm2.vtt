00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.140
war is a universal language I know

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.160
renegade soldier when I see one

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.720
never occurred to me that one might come

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.260
from above

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.780

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.780
mccartey

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.620

but I can't tell if it's real

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.310

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.969
we can't do this alone

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.219
